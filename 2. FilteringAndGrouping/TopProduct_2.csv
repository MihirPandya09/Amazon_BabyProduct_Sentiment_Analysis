Mine had been in my cold mailbox awhile, but whether in cold or heat, just try to give it time to really adjust to room temp.  I was in no hurry, I waited an hour, but probably didn't need to wait that long.<br /><br />ALSO LOOK at example of WHERE to place it, not too close or too far from forehead and I place above the center of my eyebrows.<br /><br />BOTTOMLINE:  GLAD I got it.

It's heavier,  more solid,  reads<br />the temp in a second and shuts off in 8 seconds.  It doesn't stay on a half day and drain the battery.<br />It looks and feels like a professional instrument,  not a cheap light plastic toy.  If it continues to function<br />the way that it's doing,  it is worth every penny and is a fair price.  As things are now,  I would buy it<br />again.  I am telling you the honest total truth,  this is a good one.  Not colored or fancy looking,  just<br />a plain simple,  well made instrument that does what it is supposed to do...<br /><br />11-18-20<br />This one that I have reviewed is still just like the day that I received it.

Not intentional; just happened to be that way. I didn't expect to get a temperature but lo and behold - apparently my blanket is 90.1° (because there's no way it could pick up my foot from that)<br />I also did my ear (again, just cuz) and my wrist. My ear was 92.8° so I guess I'm dead. My wrist was the same temp as my forehead - 96.6°<br />I have been seriously bored the past couple days so I've been playing with this - my forehead has not changed. Neither has my wrist. I took the temp of every place in my body - always 96.6 No matter what day, no matter what time of day, no matter if I have a headache or not - same temp from head to toe (except when it says I'm dead lol)<br />I have news for you: your temp changes throughout the day. For example, it'll typically run slightly higher after exercise because your body is working harder than usual and lower after rest. Not too mention the fact that some parts of your body run hotter than others so it makes absolutely no sense that no matter what the circumstance - the time of day, if I had a headache, if I had just eaten or I hadn't eaten all day; it truly doesn't matter - the temp remained 96.6° (except the one time with my ear that was 92.8° - i.e. dead)<br /><br />I got this for COVID-19; no contact and all.

The iHealth thermometer consistently read at least 1 degree F BELOW the other thermometer.  Everyone was around the 98.6 degree temperature, but iHealth always came back with 97.3, 97.7, etc.  If you have a fever, you need to know your exact temperature.  105 vs 106 degrees is important.<br /><br />I emailed support under the 12 month warranty and this was their response (basically, it's ok to be 1 degree off):<br /><br />""Please note that different measurement sites (rectal, axillary, oral, frontal, auricular) will give different readings. Therefore it not a direct correlation to compare the measurement taken from different sites.<br /><br />An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. A forehead (temporal) scanner is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature.  This is the reason that you are seeing readings that are 1 degree lower than what we are accustomed to which is the oral temperature.<br /><br />The measurement precision: ±0.4°F within 95°F-107.6°F, and±0.5°F for other temperature ranges.<br /><br />But, keep in mind, body temperature varies from person to person and fluctuates during the course of the day. For this reason, it is suggested to know one's normal, healthy forehead temperature to correctly determine the temperature.<br /><br />Other issues that can affect the forehead temperature are sweat, air temperature, hair, if a person's head has been covered.<br /><br />Thank you for your understanding,""",B075QQ8VZW,True

I bought the iHealth model based primarily on the reviews and the reasonable price.<br /><br />Use is pretty easy.  Hold it near your head and press the button.  It will vibrate once it gets a reading.  Mine seems to work best when I hold it very close to my forehead, either close to touching or actually touching my skin.<br /><br />When I got it I checked the repeatability.  I took three temperature measurements in a row and they all agreed to within 0.1 degrees.<br /><br /> I have no way of judging the absolute accuracy, but it generally gives me temperature readings in the 97.5ish degree range.  This is close enough to the readings that I get on the very expensive FLIR system at work that I'm going to call it good enough.  The numbers are big and bright in the readout, which is nice.<br /><br />Accuracy aside, the biggest benefit of this thermometer is that it makes taking your temperature quick and convenient.  You don't have to wait 2 minutes for a reading.  Instead, you get one in a few seconds, so there less of an excuse to avoid doing it.<br /><br />One thing to note is that skin temperature is usually lower than with an oral or underarm thermometer.  I see about a 1 degree difference, but I'm not sure how typical that is. Once you test yourself a few times you'll develop a feel for what your average value is.",B075QQ8VZW,True

I found it disappointing because the readings according to the amount of pressure one applied when moving the lens from temple to temple. So, the accuracy was determined to some extent by variations connected with the user. I also did not like the need to have skin contact. So, I searched around for an infrared non-contact forehead thermometer and was bewildered by the large number available with many having both good and bad reviews. I eventually settled on this thermometer. Fortunately, I have not had much cause to use it. However, it is so easy to use compared to the other thermometer that I am delighted with it.

The iHealth instrument is pretty compact and quite easy to use; in fact, I have been able to successfully point it at my own forehead and get a complete reading.  The result window is a little misleading in that it does not stand-out as in a typical LCD/LED screen, but once the reading is complete the result is easy to read.<br />While I have not completed an NIST traceable accuracy test (and won't), I find that the results are comparable to the Braun in-ear instrument.  I would not expect them to be exact as temps are taken in two different places on your body.  I trust it to tell me if I need to seek medical attention, just as I do the Braun unit.<br />Overall, the iHealth thermometer is easy to use, compact, and accurate as compared to our other thermometer.

I've used the Exergen temporal thermometer before and found it easy to use and accurate; I was expecting the same as this one. The iHealth thermometer has an easy-to-read screen, however, measuring the center of the forehead as instructed does not get you an accurate reading. I had a severe fever(104+F), but the reading on the thermometer only gave 99F. However, if you do find the temporal artery which may be far from the forehead, it is much more accurate.

Until now, we haven't had need for it. Unfortunately, I did need it today (leg infection), and I ran into the same issue many others here have mentioned.<br /><br />Convenient? Yes. Fast? Very. Accurate? **NO, NOT AT ALL.** First, there are fresh batteries in the unit, so that's not a problem. I know how to hold the thermometer an inch or less from center of forehead. It had been sitting in the room for hours, so not an ambient temp issue.<br /><br />I knew I had a fever because I felt so flushed and was shivering badly. But this unit displayed 97.3. After another hour or so, it read 98.1 So I decided to test it against two oral thermometers we have. One read 101.5 and the other 101.4. Obviously, that's quite a difference. I rechecked several times over a period of 3 hrs and kept getting very incorrect results.<br /><br />Regrettably, I'd say try a different thermometer.

With only one button its incredibly easy to use and the readings are consistent and appear to be accurate. I also really like the vibration feedback to let you know when its got the reading. This is great for taking temps of sleeping babies or children. There is no noise to wake them up! the only thing that would really make this better in my mind would be a case.

293947,2021-10-23 21:42:49,5.0,Works over and over and over again at a Dr's office.,"I work at a doctor's office, both up front as a medical secretary and in the back as a nurse rooming patients. I was getting really sick of our old thermometers and their constant issues. Their temp readings were too low, then too high, always inconsistent and the batteries needed changing all the time. Finally, I had had it. I couldn't take it anymore and came here, onto Amazon to look at replacing them, hoping to end the frustration once and for all.<br /><br />I found this one right away and was drawn in by the fact that it had roughly 4.5 ⭐ and a sh*t-ton of reviews. I realized I actually recognized it, as it was the same kind that had been used to take my temperature by many various places throughout the span of the pandemic we are unfortunately in the middle of. I figured if it worked for them over and over and over and over again, it would probably do the same for my office and so I ordered it. It came the next day and was super easy to get started. Insert batteries, put battery cover on and go.<br /><br />One thing I do want to point out is the directions say to position it about an adult finger-width away from the forehead and I definitely recommend following that instruction. If you have it further away, it isn't always able to read the person's temperature and won't work. But as long as you read the instructions and follow them, instead of thinking you know everything and don't need to read the instructions for a simple thermometer, it works pretty well so far. It's super quick and seems to be a lot more accurate than the ones we used to use!<br /><br />I definitely recommend it to anyone from someone who lives alone and just wants one to keep on hand, all the way up to a doctor's office who is going to be using it repeatedly, every day. If anything changes, I would love to tell you I will come back on here and edit this review to reflect the changes, but let's be honest, life happens and there aren't enough hours in the day to accomplish everything we want to accomplish. So, while I can't promise you that I will, what I can promise you is that I will try, despite what Yoda said about there not being able try....",B075QQ8VZW,True

I had to try it a couple of times to finally get a reading (this was the somewhat easy to use).<br />2.  If I do something wrong it changes from ""F"" to ""C"".  Not sure but had my kid read the instructions to change it back.<br />3.  The instructions are tiny for me to read, even with my reading glasses.<br />4.

I bought this during the sale days in October for $14.99 and I've had to use it a dozen times already unfortunately with Chicago crazy weather and viruses coming along with it. You can exchange regular batteries versus button batteries. It's accurate and simple to use. Put it close to your forehead and hold the button at the same time you will feel a vibration and poof you have your temperature displayed brightly. I'm so glad I purchased this. I forwarded the sale to three of my friends soon to be Grandma's and they all purchased one.

Batteries included; easy to work, and I like that it either beeps or vibrates when temp is taken.  I've always been leery of under the tongue thermometers, but gauged this one against my old under the tongue one, and both registered the same.; hence it's accurate.  This unit was a few dollars less than most, but, so far, it works very well; so I recommend it highly.  Do read the directions which come with it, and it's easy to maneuver through the few steps.

But I figured it was a worthwhile investment. But I’m having trouble getting accurate readings. I’m aiming where the directions say and always getting lower than accurate temps.

I tried it over 30 times with them this morning and there was no change in the reading.  I know ear, mouth, rectal and forehead thermometers have baseline variances, but I sincerely doubt all three of us basically have the same temperature<br /><br />I pulled out the old digital ear thermometer and consistently get a reading over 101 for the kids.

When we had the coronavirus, it only registered over 100 twice, and we are positive that was not right. Then it registered consistently 97.3 for a while, then 98.2 or 98.0 for a couple of weeks. Now it’s been registering over 100, for both of us, for several days. Regular thermometer says 97.6, which is my normal temperature. This is extremely inaccurate. It’s always kept in the box in a safe place, never been dropped, never been placed near extreme heat. Always in a safe spot. Return policy is only 30 days, but this is too much for something to work only a couple of months. We didn’t realize how in accurate it was until we started checking with a regular thermometer. There should be a crime selling this during this pandemic! All the people who have this worthless piece of equipment should get their money back! Amazon, you need to do something about this. I spent a lot of money at your company, and this is just wrong! I hope I will hear from you soon. You need to stop selling this product if it’s going to be wrong like this.

580975,2022-06-23 07:04:37,1.0,"Defective product, ridiculous return process","I wish I had an opportunity to give this product a fair chance, but I received a bad one. The interface would light up and blink when I put in the batteries, but the thermometer would never successfully read anybody's temperature. I even swapped in a fresh pair of batteries just for troubleshooting purposes, but I still had no luck.  This alone would not have been enough for me to give this a one-star review.  I know that sometimes you just get unlucky and you receive a dud.<br /><br />What really frustrated me was the return process.  For whatever reason, when I tried to exchange the product, Amazon only gave me an option to chat with a support agent.  I did not see the usual option allowing me to simply print a return label.  So now I'm stuck having a 30 minute conversation with an Amazon support agent who takes forever to get back to me, and who asks me a million insulting questions implying that this whole thing might amount to user error.<br /><br />I am eventually provided an e-mail from Amazon through this support agent in which I am instructed to contact the seller.  I guess this was a third party seller -- maybe that was the reason why I couldn't simply request a quick and easy return label.  I followed a link in the e-mail and contacted the seller requesting an exchange rather than a full refund.  I waited 48 hours, and I just got fed up and quit.  I guess I could have waited a bit longer, but I really don't feel like jumping through a million hoops over this lousy product.  I eventually hopped back onto chat with Amazon support and just asked for a return label.  They advised me that the return window had already closed, which I find highly suspect since I purchased the product fewer than four (4) days ago.  Anyhow, I complained enough and got my money back. But why was any of this so hard?  I was originally trying to get an exchange for my defective product instead of outright returning it, but this whole process frustrated me to the point where I just wanted to be done with it all.<br /><br />So yeah, I'm sorry to be that guy who drops a one-star rating and says, ""Received a broken one, so it sux"".  But I'm angry and frustrated now, and I think you should avoid this product due to poor quality control, and because the seller is somehow making it really difficult for customers to initiate a product return.",B075QQ8VZW,True

The thermometers at my workplace can be frustrating and glitchy, require physical contact (temporal), therefore requiring disinfection between each patient, waiting for disinfectant to dry etc. Having a touchless thermometer that reads so quickly helps keep the efficiency up. Of course if the patient moves and touches the sensor, disinfecting comes back into the picture.<br /><br />I tested it on myself and found it to be accurate to my typical temporal temp of 97.3.

616801,2021-02-24 20:04:14,3.0,Easy to use but not especially accurate. Okay as an index.,"We got one of these for the same reason everyone else in the world did last year, once the price-gouging eased up. It's simple to use -- point at forehead, squeeze trigger once to activate and again to measure, which produces a vibration to confirm. Check the readout for your temperature.<br /><br />It works, and will show you if someone's temperature is up or down from where it was -- provided you take into account the base reading is not accurate. I have a consistently dead normal human temp of 98.6, which every mercury or electronic under-tongue thermometer has confirmed. But on this device, I'm 97.7. This will still tell me if I have a fever, so long as I keep in mind whatever it shows will be .9 degrees lower than the actual temperature. Move it closer or to another spot on the forehead and the reading is the same.<br /><br />If you weren't paying attention, this could mean interpreting a fever as being less than it actually is, which could matter. I don't know if this is common with forehead infrared thermometers, as this is our first one, but the fact this device is inaccurate is less than ideal. Otherwise it works fine and is easy to use. I'll just have to remember if it ever shows 98.6 that it's telling me I have a fever.<br /><br />Three stars for a useable but inaccurate thermometer.",B075QQ8VZW,True

After switching it back to Fahrenheit and buying a regular thermometer that goes under the tongue, the readings were 4 degrees apart, with the new thermometer showing the higher reading.

It seems to be luck of the draw whether you get a device that is properly calibrated.  I have taken my temperature several times and I have never gotten a reading higher than 97.8.  When I first got it out of the box, I took a reading - 97.3.  I used my old mercury thermometer and got a reading of 98.3.  The next day, I went to my dentist, and his no touch infrared thermometer read 98.8.  When I got home, I tried my IHealth and got a reading of 97.8. My wife also registered these same 1 degree differences ( we went to the dentiist together) I have tried every method; index finger width from middle of forehead, 1 inch from middle of forehead as noted in the instructions. with no deviation in the readings.  I can live with doing the math, add one degree for a true reading; however, I'm not sure if this will apply if I truly have a fever.

After attempting several times to properly take a temperature on myself, my husband, and my kids, I got the hang of using it properly. However, this is not accurate, no matter how close or far away the thermometer was, it was usually 2-3 degrees off. Having two toddlers, one who suffers from febrile seizures, that is a large range. Our other thermometer is way more accurate, so I think we’ll just stick with temporal thermometers rather than one that can’t even give “close enough” readings… Either this product is somehow working for other customers for them to give it such high reviews or they don’t realize how inaccurate this actually is.

I have tried multiple different ways, i.e. touching to forehead, wrist, neck, temple, etc. as well as holding it from a distance to try to do it “touch-less” like it claims it does. I finally was able to get numbers to show up, and have been able to since on a few occasions; but it is the same numbers every single time: “96.5° F”. I have tested it on myself, my son, my dad, and my mom. And on the few times it will show any numbers, it always reads “96.5° F”. Even the time when I knew that my son had a fever of over 100° F.  And 2 different “cheapo” thermometers read and confirmed the exact same 100.1° F temperature.

1169900,2020-06-16 07:57:08,4.0,Location is key,"Everything about this thermometer is great, except it reads my forehead a degree or so low. But with trial and error, I think I have I have a solution that should work for at least some of you.<br /><br />So our baseline temperature is suppose to be our internal temperature. It makes sense that temples would read low, there's nothing internal about that part of the body.<br /><br />Earlier this evening I was feeling too warm, and at one point the bottom of my feet felt hot for a few minutes. After taking readings all around my head, neck, ears, even had it half way in my mouth pointed under my tongue, it was time to delve deeper.<br /><br />Under the tongue was the closest to my baseline (so far). After my arms being down for a bit, my armpits were the first to recognize that my sensation of overheating had merit. So I checked other areas where my skin overlaps. All gave me the same reading as my armpit. By the time my feet felt hot I was barefoot and ready and that hot sensation in my feet read 101.5, (big blood vessels run through the arches of our feet). Only for a minute though, as my feet felt cooler, and the thermometer reflected that by dropping to 99.5. By then, all the folds and creases were reading 99.5. All the while my forehead stayed in the 97's. And it makes sense that I'm getting warm. I was diagnosed with pneumonia 4 days ago (not COVID related thank goodness).<br /><br />My conclusion: armpit or other folds give most accurate readings. Touch is more accurate than no touch.<br /><br />But if you document your baseline *forehead* temperature (which I'd reasonably assume is 1 to 2 degrees below your *internal* baseline temperature), then it would still be efficient to be aware in an increase to that temperature, at which point, do an armpit scan for more medically accurate reading, so you can respond accordingly.<br /><br />Otherwise, all I can say about this thing is I love how quickly it does readings, a couple seconds at most. If it's taking longer for you, you are probably holding it too far away. An inch or less distance is ideal.<br /><br />Construct: looks and feels well made. It vibrates momentarily once it has your reading, and the included batteries are still going after 100 readings (it's 2 AAA's, not sure how long it takes IR and vibration to use up their charge).<br /><br />Overall, with a little trial and error, I figured out how to get it to fulfill my needs with the readings, and everything else about it is great.",B075QQ8VZW,True

She told me to try new batteries and when I told her to read the chat text, she was borderline combative and overall a very poor representative.

I'm generally pleased with it, but you MUST recognize the limitations of this type of thermometer.  Here are the pros and cons as I see them:<br /><br />PROS(+):<br />- This is a VERY easy to use thermometer.  Aim, shoot, push the button, and in a second it vibrates and shows the temperature.  No long wait or confusion.<br />-It's external, so no open mouth or rectum-- no risk of being infected with a virus by taking someone's temperature.<br />-It's highly portable (I kept it in my purse/backpack) and doesn't require covers or the like.<br />-It' going to give you the general gist of whether someone has a fever, with the caveat that if the person has been by a heat source (sitting in the direct sun or next to a fireplace), the temp may be high and you may need to retake it a few minutes to check.<br /><br />CONS (-):<br />The biggest con is that this is an external thermometer, so it's never going to be as accurate as an internal thermometer.  At certain times on our trip, I would be temporarily alarmed when my temperature registered as 100+.  Every time, it was when I had either been sitting in a long car ride in the direct sunlight, sitting next to the fireplace in our hotel room, etc.  So, I waited a few minutes, away from the heat source (or with the a/c on), and then registered a normal temperature.  (It also sometimes registered 100+ on the side of my forehead where the sun was beating down in the car, and 97-98 on the other side of my forehead!)  I can see this being an issue with daycares, schools, sports teams, and would thus suggest taking the temps in a cool space after people have cooled down a bit, and retaking in 5 minutes.  As I mentioned above, it may also give different temperatures on different sides of your forehead depending on external factors.  However, if you really do have a fever, it would (should) give a high reading on every part of your body, so I do think the effects of external factors on the accuracy can be fixed by simply taking temps in a cool place, and following up with another reading a few minutes later.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't use it in a pediatrician's office (they should use internal thermometers for sure), but I think it's a great, portable thermometer for a mom/family to easily and quickly check for fevers in this current pandemic environment.",B075QQ8VZW,True

1406806,2020-06-14 02:29:37,5.0,Super sleek high tech unit,Initial impression is “ I like it!”.  The unit is really high tech looking.  No colorful screens and gimmicks to deal with.  It’s so sleek it took me a minute to find the cover to install the batteries!  As far as accuracy is concerned it will take some testing.  I will update this post soon.  I definitely would consider this tester if your planning on getting one.<br />I see a lot of people saying the reading doesn’t change much. I got out a hair dryer and put some warm air on my forehead just to warm the skin a bit since I seemed to get a 97.1 reading every time I checked.  Ola! The reading went up to 101.6 and my head was warm as if I had a fever.  So it probably works but the true test is compare it to a mercury thermometer in your mouth.  But it will probably always read a little low when measuring your forehead. Your forehead is exposed to the ambient air and dissipates heat quickly.  Another way is to purchase a stick on thermometer  and put that on your forehead and compare readings. I tried rubbing my forehead quickly to get it warm but there was no change in the reading.  The hair dryer/heat gun got the temperature reading to rise above 97.1.  Still as far as accuracy goes I haven’t gotten that far yet.  I use this as a tool and quick indicator that a person MAY have a fever. In the end a thermometer in the mouth is still the best method to be sure. If you don’t have a thermometer remember how our mothers use to do it... place the back of your hand on your forehead... you will know if your warm!,B075QQ8VZW,True

My daughter was recently sick, and I used this thermometer, which said her temperature was 99.4 degrees, but I knew she felt warmer than this, so when I used a traditional thermometer, she was actually 104.2.

My baby felt warm to me but the thermometer kept saying she was 98, 97.6, and 98.4 and that my husband and I were 97.3 and 97.4. But I really felt like my baby had a fever. So we decided to take her temp rectally and she actually had a 101.7 fever!!!  Too bad my return window has closed but honestly, save yourself the money. I don’t know where and how the other positive reviews came about but this one is absolutely not the one to get. I read all reviews and articles before going for this one and boy, did we get this one wrong. It’ll now go into my baby’s play doctor kit.

If it consistently measure a couple of degrees low all the time I could get used to that. But it measures low sometimes, WAY low other times and doesn't measure at all sometimes. The directions are not very helpful either. The people who rated this 5 stars either have more patience than I or got a better product than I received.

I checked the accuracy on myself and children. The temperatures were a little lower than I am used to seeing on ou, 97.5-97.9.

It seems to be most accurate when you can get about a finger-width distance from the forehead, between and just above the eyes.

I have trouble hearing high pitch sounds so the vibration this emits in your hand when the reading is confirmed works great for me. Although most of the no touch thermometers seem to have a switch to turn off the sound, if you do that then seeing the display is the only way to know the reading has been made. If you’re checking your own temperature you’d need to stand in front of a mirror to confirm a reading. Or if you’re checking a child’s temperature in bed the vibration would be convenient to know the temperature has been recorded. This doesn’t store temperatures so if you think that’s important you might want to get a different thermometer.<br /><br />Edit: I liked the first one I ordered so much that I bought 3 more for all the members of the family.

Overall Consumer Rating Group Size was Accomplished by Almost 121,000 Consumers. The majority of its Ratings was very Positive. I also purchased an Oral Under the Tongue Thermometer, which was also Highly Approved by Consumers (Over 70,000 Consumer Rated). The No Touch Thermometer was very quick in obtaining my Forehead Temperature. Tested the Thermometer 50 times over a 2 week period. All temperatures were obtained within a 1 to 2 second time frame and was lightning fast. I also Used my New Oral Thermometer as a Backup Reference.  Both the No Touch Digital Thermometer and the Oral Digital Thermometer were within .1 of each other. In fact, most of the readings compared with each other were Exactly the same. I will admit I studied at least 20 various Digital Thermometers over a 3 month time frame.  All have in common the same complaints, They take too long to display a reading, They are Not Accurate, They Quit Working after a Couple of Months. My Reasoning States, Find any item you want to purchase and then look at the Largest Consumer Group that Rated the Desired Item. Discover What Ratings they gave the Item. Read the Good and Bad Reviews on the item. In the End, as in my case, 117,000 Consumers Out of Almost 121,000 Consumers, Rated the Thermometer 5 Stars, I feel the Product is Probably Worth Owning and Trustworthy.

Hold this thing close to the forehead, push the button in and you get a reading in about 1 second. This thing looks good, feels good, and is accurate (we’ve tested with an additional thermometer). We’ve used multiple thermometers in the past. The head scanner that you run across the forehead...no good. In-ear thermometers...actuate, but expect a battle. Rectal thermometers...very accurate, but expect a war. This is the easiest one out of all of them. We find it especially useful when we need the quick “I don’t feel that great” check...ie man cold.

2060530,2020-10-08 03:48:32,2.0,97.3 occurs too often for too many people. So the 98.6 is false advertising.,97.3 *all* the time. In the grand scheme of things - it’s entirely possible that might be the new average and 98.6 is an outdated stat we’ve not questioned. Evolution happens. But I’ve seen way too many people mention the exact same thing. So either 1) This is inaccurate and I’m really 98.6 2) 98.6 is for a thermometer inserted in the mouth and under the tongue and this 97.3 is the surface temp.<br /><br />On balance I’d prefer if it provided a calibration setting to zero it. Eg: use it with no fever and they will default it to 98.6 and then this just tracks a delta to that. Eg: Add +1.3F to every reading. But let readers know it’s been calibrated.,B075QQ8VZW,True

I took my son's temperature 3 times in 5 minutes, and all 3 were significantly different than each other.<br /><br />Finally, I found this one.

I knew traditional mouth thermometers were not an option as they could get easily broken, lost and fear of used by more than one mouth. I had a Braun Scan No Touch at home that I've used for years that I have been very happy with - and have compared it to the traditional mouth thermometer with the same (or very close to the same) temperature results. However, during COVID-19 that has not been available in stores or online - so I finally made the choice to get two of these iHealth brands. We've had them a few days now and just testing them compared to the Braun they've been spot on reporting the same temperature. The display is clear, it is easy to use and if the temperature reports accurately I am very happy. Only con I see is that it does not BEEP while taking the temperature telling you when to stop moving it along your forehead (however if you are taking your own temperature and looking in a mirror you will see the display flash you will see when the temp appears - and for my college kids they can handle this of course) - and the button to hold while taking the temp is a little easy to push so if you are packing it in something tight it may easily get turned on when you don't intend. So I'd suggest getting the semi-hard case that does with it to stop this from happening. I'd buy this iHealth model again as the price is right and it's accurate.",B075QQ8VZW,True

2328566,2020-06-15 16:38:48,5.0,"Simple to use, well made and compact in size.","There are those that look like a pistol which promises more functions.  However they all tend to be bigger and more expensive.  This one is small making it easy to store in the medicine cabinet and carry with you on a trip.  It is simple and quick to use and looks nice and elegant.  I assume one must operate it correctly to ensure consistency and accuracy.  I measured myself three times and the variations were less than 0.2 °F within the spec.  I use it to monitor my temperature in the time of COVID-19 even at home as per my company's guideline.  This thermometer makes this daily task a breeze.<br /><br />A few things to add after reading some negative reviews:<br />First, as you compare this to your ""old and trusted"" existing thermometer, do not assume the existing one is more accurate.  For one, your ""other"" thermometers most likely do not measure temperature at the forehead so they will return different readings.  Second, I am a biologist and know scientific thermometers from different brands/batch can vary temperature readings by as much as 1.5 °C.  The mercury ones are more accurate.  So the key is to establish your baseline and then assess whether your current reading is substantially above.  No matter which part of your body you measure, >100°F indicates fever.  Finally you have to point this at the same spot to get consistent reading. The instruction also says the optimal distance to your forehead is about 1 inch.",B075QQ8VZW,True

While yes I have gotten those two numbers, I’ve also gotten other temps on my children.<br /><br />When my toddler spiked a fever, this device registered a 102.8, and I checked with the Braun In-Ear thermometer and that read a 103. Even when you use other thermometers, it can read a different temp off by a couple of decimal points when you use check it twice back to back. Second time checking with the Braun registered a 102.6…so this no touch device is definitely within range.<br /><br />I use it primarily on my newborn who cannot use the ear thermometer just yet, and it’s a quick estimate to make sure he’s not spiking a fever. It lights up in the dark with a clean and clear display, and also vibrates to let you know the temp has been collected. Only takes about a second or two, so again it’s perfect for squirming children who cannot hold still.<br /><br />We’ve paid 14.99 for an under the tongue regular thermometer from a drugstore in a pinch - so this one priced at 20 bucks is well worth it in my opinion.

Now, I can’t get the thing to read no matter how many times I try, or who I use it on. I’ve changed the batteries multiple times, and opted to give it a moment to “cool down”, only to have it not give any readings, just the initial “—-“ screen.<br /><br />Long story short. I apparently cannot return it or be refunded despite only having it 3 days. So I have ordered a Vicks scanning thermometer and it should be here within 2 days.

It gave me wildly different readings every time. I took my own temperature, 97.1, 99.9, 100.8, you name it... wild, all over the map. Went to the store and bought an in-ear ""pediatrician recommended"" thermometer, and got consistent readings of over 103 on our daughter and 98.4/98.5/98.6 on us healthy adults.<br /><br />Not only is this thing inaccurate, I'd say it's potentially dangerous. If we a little less skeptical, we could easily think everything was fine and that it was just a slightly elevated teething fever, which it was clearly not. If you're trying to decide if it's time to take your child to urgent care, this is not the thermometer you want to be stuck with.

Verify accuracy.,"As with all forehead thermometers, there are many variables that can affect the reading, as well as them reading on the low side (usually be 1F or so). Aware of that we were sure to use it the same way every time as well as taking our temps when we were healthy to get a good baseline reading, and also testing at least 3 times in succession. After a few illnesses (RSV, colds, etc) we felt it was good enough as it would show us when our kid was over 100F etc. However, recently we discovered it's no longer accurate (or maybe never was). Testing at home right before a trip to the Dr showed 98.2, however, 10 min later, the Dr tested in-ear and measured 102. I went to the store and purchased a Braun 7 in-ear and have been using both to get a sense of accuracy. Normal temp (myself) showed 98.5 on the Braun, and 97.3 (normal for my ihealth), which seems right for what I was used to observing. Tested on my kid again, 102 in-ear, 98.2 ihealth.<br /><br />Now my spouse and I wonder if when our kid showed 102 previously on the iHealth, was she actually 104 or 105?

At first it seemed to be within tolerable accuracy and, as a newly elected stay at home dad I loved it’s convenience.

Compared with my pediatrician’s various mid-quality pocket thermometers just to see when at the office and theirs were always within a tenth or two variance versus this one’s 3.9 degree variance.  To those of you who will read this and have a brain, as a parent, caretaker, or any educated person, that range of inaccuracy should be all you need to know.<br />However, now with a second newborn I thought I’d see what a fresh set of quality batteries did to this one to spot check, since it had been stored  (without batteries) for “if I really need something like this next round”.  As another review mentioned, the temp of three different healthy adults registered at 97.3, then the baby at over 101… terrified, we broke out the nicer unit, which showed a consistent 98.1 on the adults and a 98.3 on the infant.<br />I went to put it in the donate pile, but instead came to the conclusion I didn’t wish this on another human, so I mashed it good with a brick and tossed it in the trash where it belongs.

I don’t know how on earth this item received so many positive reviews, I suspect it must be from unwitting customers that carry on believing that the reading they received from the device was accurate. This brings me to the purpose of my review: because thermometer reliability is essential at the times that you actually need to use one (sick infant, a spouse that’s ill, etc), having an inaccurate device is extraordinarily dangerous to consumers. If you are misled by a thermometer reading, you may choose the wrong course of action that could conceivably be deadly or dangerous to those around the sick individual.

I'm a nurse practitioner, and this is the most unreliable thermometer I've ever used. It reads different temperatures every time and was reading ""normal"" when my son was really sick and felt very hot to the touch. I went out to buy an oral thermometer that day because I was worried about him and could tell he was febrile. His temperature reached over 104 degrees on the new thermometer and was reading as just over 100 on this piece of garbage (I checked with both to validate my suspicion that it was grossly inaccurate).<br /><br />One silver lining is that I entertained my sick child by reading his temperature aloud from this thing. He giggled so hard at the big difference in each reading, like this:<br />*scan* 98.7<br />*scan* 100.1<br />*scan* 98.4<br />*scan* 99.8<br />While I was doing this his oral temp reading was over 102.<br /><br />Do not buy this. If you need a reliable temporal thermometer, stick to the Exergen. The oral thermometer we bought during the great temporal thermometer crisis of 2022 was the Kinsa Bluetooth thermometer. It has an app where you can log what interventions were given and it gives recommendations based on the height of the fever. I bought it at Target and at the time we had a local health emergency from RSV so there were very few in store options.

First thing first it feels really good doesn't feel cheap. I've seen a lot of people saying it's inaccurate so I looked into another woman's video and she was scanning different parts of the forehead saying inaccurate.. like what! That's not how you check temperature.. of course our body has different temperatures. you have to check the middle of the forehead even has instructions if you're confused about that. The display is great the n umbers light up a nice white not like the other no touch thermometers that has a huge screen showing the stoplight colors lol it vibrates so you no you have a reading. No loud beeps to wake the kids up. For the price this is totally worth it!,B075QQ8VZW,True

The battery light then began appearing again just a couple of months after I loaded much higher-quality replacement batteries.

Maybe it’s because my kids get to them and play with them or maybe it’s because when they are sick, I check their temps 50 billion times a day (a kid running a 106 fever will scar you for life). Regardless, the thermometer gods do not shine favorably on me. I was excited about this because my last no touch thermometer was the best thing since sliced bread (getting temps while sleeping is not an easy task). I bought this because of all of the high star ratings. The first few times we used it, it was pretty amazing. Easy to read, easy to work with, sleek design that made the adult in me happy… but then, my kid was clearly running a temperature and the thermometer said his temp was 95 degrees. Nay nay, sir. I know a hot forehead when I feel it. So, I took my own temp… 91 degrees. What am I, dead? Tried changing the batteries, tried troubleshooting… still was reading incredibly inaccurate. What bums me out the most is that this thermometer lasted me the shortest amount of time than any other has and my kids didn’t even play with it that much. To top it off, it quit working right as the return window closed. Thus is my thermometer luck. On the bright side, my kids now have a thermometer to play around with so they can leave the new one I had to buy alone.",B075QQ8VZW,True

It’s highly inaccurate and I didn’t realize it at first, so I trusted the thing, even though my children had “glassy” eyes and felt super hot.  I finally went and bought a different kind of thermometer and tried it, and then I tried an old under-the-arm thermometer I found lying around, and those ones both read temps of over 103 while this one read 99.1.  I felt terrible that I had been trusting this thing for so long, instead of listening to my mom instincts.  Also, for those saying you just have to use it correctly and then it’s accurate, trust me, I’ve been using it correctly.  I always hold it a centimeter or 2 away from the center of the forehead and I hold it still.  And I’ve tried time and time again and it always gives about the same temp, even when I check it on my feverish child and then check myself, it tells me we both have about 98.8-99.1 temps.  I even tried installing brand new good batteries, and it still read exactly 99.1 on my child who was running a fever over 103, according to both other thermometers.  Waste of money.

One time it read above 100 degrees and I almost panicked. It was the first person we had come in contact with that had a fever. But just to make sure, we had a backup ear thermometer. That one read that it was well within a normal range (around 98 degrees). I had startled the patient and almost sent them home. Who knows what might have cascaded from that. They might have panicked bc they thought they were getting sick, they might have contacted others they had close contact with, they might waited in a long line for a test and waited days for the results (tests weren’t readily available at that time)… Or we could have just looked dumb. They might have gone home and tested and found out they were fine. Luckily we had a backup just in case something like this happened and avoided the potential annoyance a poor reading could have caused.<br /><br />We ended using for another year but made sure to keep the backup nearby. The backup wasn’t as easy to use and requires contact, but it seems much more accurate. The ihealth has had several times where reading varied. We might have kept using it though bc it was so simple but it broke down after about a year. I still have the Braun tho and it’s been pretty solid. Just wish it didn’t need that stupid plastic piece and I would gladly buy another one.<br /><br />Im currently looking for another thermometer and I can’t believe this one has so many good reviews.

All day it gave me 97.3 readings, then when I got to my doctor's appointment in the late afternoon, I found out I was running 100.8. It was shocking to find out I was definitely sick, and definitely contagious. When I got home, I wanted to test this product, and, you guessed it, 97.3. I pulled out an oldschool oral thermometer, 101.2.<br /><br />So. Make sure to double up, use a secondary thermometer and check your product.

At that time, I read the instructions and it did take a while to get some readings.  My temperature usually runs a little low and it seemed to be giving correct readings.  I put it away and never had a reason to use it until today.  My companion was feeling bad with a cough, congestion, tired and aching.  I took his temp with the PT3 and it read 98.6.  I took my temp and it read 96.8.  My companion felt very warm, so I took his temp with my old thermometer under the tongue.  His temp was 101.2.  After that, I tried several times to take his temp with the PT3 again.  It would light up but never gave another temp reading.  I'm sorry I bought this thermometer!  It doesn't work properly.  Since it's been a year, I can't ask for a refund, but I just want everyone considering this thermometer to know my experience.

Recently, I started to feel feverish. Using this thermometer, the highest reading I got was 98°. I’ve always had a low temp so figured I had a low grade fever. After a night of sweating through THREE shirts, I put a battery in my old oral one. It registered at 101.5! That’s a difference of 2.5 degrees! In today’s health climate, they seems unacceptable.

Seems to work great as far as I can tell. Small and very easy to use. Amended review: I have had a chance to test its accuracy against an oral thermometer. For the most part they are the same. 97.7 vs 97.6 or 98.0 vs 98.2... You get the idea. I had my temperature taken yesterday before I could go up to my doctor's appt. I took my temp before I went and it was 97.7 and 97.6 with my thermometers. Their roll across the forehead type consistently puts me at 96.2 to 96.8.... the lady taking the temperature agreed that what she uses isn't too accurate. So I give this one a thumbs up.

Then I bought a forehead thermometer from the store - it consistently gave errors because she needed to not move for 30s...impossible!  The only time I could get a reading was when she was asleep....and then the beep would wake her up or I’d have to leave the room to read it.  Plus it was all over the place -97.1 one minute, 99.5 the next!<br /><br />This thermometer?  Amazing!  It works quickly - she still needs to be still, but only for a second, so she barely realizes I’m holding her head.  The readings are silent, and lit!  I love it so much.  I’ve tested it against myself and oral thermometers and it’s consistent.<br /><br />I love it!",B075QQ8VZW,True

I am a primary caretaker for my disabled mother and her temperature needs to be checked every single day, sometimes multiple times per day. Shame on you for making a product and charging $50 and being less helpful than if I checked it with the back of my hand. I have tried troubleshooting this, including taking the battery out for a day and then putting them back in, but that did nothing. Instead, stupid consumer that I am, came back here to purchase another one. Why? Because it is now half the price of what I paid and still highly recommended on Amazon...and the 12 different free thermometers the home nurses and aides use are impossible to get readings with, not to mention my mother just isn’t about having it in her mouth.",B075QQ8VZW,True

I used both thermometers to compare readings and generally, every reading from this thermometer was anywhere from 97.1-98.0, whereas the Braun thermometer was a whole degree or degree and  half higher each time. Recently I could tell that one of my children was running a fever (moms know these things just from looking at our kids!) and the new thermometer read the usual 97 degrees, whereas the Braun read 101!!

With traditional digital thermometers,there’s only two ways to check a baby’s temp, rectally and under the armpit. I wasn’t about to stick something in my newborns bottom so I always checked by placing it in her armpit. Well after serval days I realized her temp was reading 96-97.5 and that’s way too low for in newborn and we even took her to the E.R. to see if she was sick. Come to find out with babies the armpit temps are always low and not as accurate and I didnt know that. So I order this handy dandy sleek forehead thermometer and it’s been amazing.

Of the 5 different kinds of thermometers we bought, this was by far the most accurate when used in the correct spot.

It is very user friendly, has a fast read time, and I can check my kids without waking them up at night. The vibration is a strong, quick buzz to let you know you got a reading without waking up your kid. The soft white light shows up in all setting, light or dark. It feels great in your hand and even my 7 year olds can properly use it on each other.<br />My only gripe is if you wear a knitted hat or scarf right before a reading, I almost guarentee the reading will be falsely elevated. We make people remove their hats and wait about 2 minutes before checking their temperature when this happens. The forhead has to be free of sweat as well, or else it picks up the temperature of the moisture on your skin and not your body temp.<br />For the home environment though, this device is the best one yet for my kids.

It was only when I came down with COVID19 and knew by the way I felt that I indeed had a fever that I learned the reading are meaningless because they remained the same as opposed to increasing.

God I didn’t rush to the hospital to get the Rona all because THIS PRODUCT DOESN'T WORK!<br /><br />I also tested it out abiding by the instructions...30 min wait time etc ...<br /><br />I took temperatures of many individuals in a production studio setting so we are following CDC guidelines and to no avail. WE ALL HAD THE SAME TEMPERATURE and it was a cold abnormal temperature.<br /><br />I’m in AZ it’s 110° outside I even stepped outside for 10 mins in direct sunlight then came back and took temperature inside.

Thank goodness we had a good old fashioned multi-use (oral/rectal/armpit - with sleeves AND disinfected between uses of course) on hand for backup and comparison! Everyone in my house had a reading of 97 point something. While that is normal for me, it's not for my adult children. To top things off, my granddaughter was sick. Was just sent home from daycare with a fever of 100.3. This thermometer read her at 97.8° !!! Used the old one, and it had gone up to to 101.3 an hour after giving her acetaminophen! Anyways... it's a beautiful thermometer. I love the concept. But it's garbage, and I'm kicking myself for buying into the beauty of the thing. Don't waste your money on this trash! Better yet... spend less money on a Vicks flexible thermometer with a HUGE backlit display! I had one that lasted me nearly 20 years, and then I lost it in move.",B075QQ8VZW,True

The same person will get different temps in the same room with no new variables. It's usually 1-2 degrees lower than readings on 3 other good thermometers.

Compared to other devices similar to this one, this one has the brightest display. I can not really attest to the accuracy as it seems to give readings similar to other ones. The design is sleek, clean lines. and lightweight. On the downside, it does not feel very durable. If you drop I feel like it might break. This is why I can't give it five stars all the way. Also, the batteries do not come installed so you have to wrestle with the battery compartment to put them in. Just have the batteries in already, makes life easier on customers.",B075QQ8VZW,True

Ever since day 1, the temperature has consistently read 97.1 on both of the thermometers I purchased. Occasionally, a reading of 97.3 is shown. I have not felt like I had a fever since I purchased these. I figured that the readings were off a little. I received my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday. Well, I experience the side effects that are common and these include body aches, fatigue, mental confusion, and fever. I took a temp with both thermometers and one said my temperature was 97.1, the other read 97.3. I used an oral thermometer that registered 99.5. I feel like I have a fever of at least 99.5.

3395281,2021-04-17 11:00:25,5.0,You have to take several temps but highest consistent temp was accurate!!,"I have a 15 month old, and we have gone through three thermometers trying to find one that works for us. Last night we took our son to the ER because this thermometer read 104-105 several times in a batch of about ten readings (I think sometimes you get a low reading/normal reading from user error). Once we got to the ER and he got a rectal temp (maybe half hour later), that reading was 105.4. So I feel safe in knowing this thermometer can read the right temp, you just have to take several readings, and whatever the most consistent, highest reading is, is most likely his temp. The reason we were even able to get my son's temp, unlike with our first normal oral thermometer (our second thermometer was a forehead one that just read the same number over and over), is because this one reads in literally a second. You don't even touch his forehead, it vibrates, and you get a reading. Our son struggled with us at first with it, being all curious and wanting to grab at it, but being such a quick and easy way to temp he finally gave in to letting us temp him without obstacle.

3617868,2020-07-25 17:09:09,5.0,"Great, accurate thermometer","I have a baby and a toddler in my house who have to go to daycare and get sick often because of it. For that reason, I already have one thermometer that reads by touching and dragging across the forehead for a reading. At the time I thought this was the best option for little ones but it’s readings are so different each time, even when I use it back to back (from 99.5-104.2 sometimes!) Those are vastly different and one scarier than the other! So I decided to get another thermometer. I usually buy products based off of reviews. Honestly there were mixed reviews on this one. But you always have to take reviews with a grain of salt meaning that most people won’t leave a review unless they’re upset or super love it. And many people may love a product but don’t want to take the time to leave a review beyond giving it a star-rating. But I kept doing research on other thermometers and found they all had mixed reviews. So I took a chance on this one because of the features offered. I loved that it’s touchless (thinking Covid). I loved that it didn’t beep when it was complete (thinking of a sleeping child). (It even comes with its own batteries-it’s the small things right?) But most importantly are the readings. Right now my children are healthy. When I tried it out on them, not only was it consistent, but it was accurate! And it read differently on each of us, again all in the normal realm but it changed between each of us but kept the same reading as the last time that forehead was scanned. So right now, this product has my full confidence. I’ll update this post if I find otherwise. I would recommend trying this one out if you need a thermometer for a young child or just need a good touchless thermometer for Covid reasons.",B075QQ8VZW,True

She has coughing and gagging issues so an under the tongue thermometer would be difficult for her to use. It's smaller than I thought it would be, very sleek and ergonomic and not bulky at all. It's very easy to operate and easy to read. It takes a temperature within seconds. There are no ""bells & whistles"" (like a memory of past readings or a storage case), which is just what I wanted. These IR thermometers are pricey but this one is very reasonable compared to the other choices.  I can't speak to the accuracy because we had nothing to compare it to, but I took reading after reading on everyone who stopped by the house and they were all within reason. Sometimes it seemed to get stuck on one reading for three consecutive tries on different people, but then the fourth would be a different number. All my ""subjects"" were sitting at rest in close proximity and this is a skin temperature reading, not an internal reading, so it's quite possible that, at normal body temperature, the ambient temperature would exert an influence on everyone's forehead and yield a similar temperature. I'm going to assume that it's accurate enough to tell the difference between a baseline temp and a fever but if I were reporting an elevated temperature to any medical personnel I would make sure they understood that it's a forehead reading.<br />I would highly recommend this model to anyone who needs an IR thermometer.",B075QQ8VZW,True

We have been extremely careful to make sure that nothing is touching the buttons and that it is off but the batteries die quickly anyway.  To deal with this we now put the batteries in when we need to use it and then immediately remove them afterwards.<br />Second, we started to notice that our temperatures were mostly reading in the 96 to low 97 degree range.  We have never had low readings like this with any other thermometers that we've owned.<br />Then came the real shock.  Since the readings were low, we tried taking multiple readings about 20 seconds apart, of the same patch of skin on the same person.  We discovered that while the readings are always on the low side, they range anywhere between 96 degrees and 97.2, a range of over 1 degree.

A  very sharp bright white  LED reading.  I ordered another one for downstairs & keep the first one upstairs.  The battery door wasn’t shutting properly.  Returned it. ordered a second and it’s off by 1° and the white LED was very dull.  Like batteries were dying.  checked batteries & were at full power. Just ordered another one.  hopefully that one will be OK.  Would’ve rated five stars if equivalent to my first.<br />Received replacement today, and again quality assurance issues. The digital white light is very dull and fuzzy. Not the bright sharp white light it’s supposed to be. Ordered a replacement. With Covid, they’re selling them too fast with people not realizing what they should be like.<br />Update: Replacements are fine. They’re just Not 100% consistent with each other.

But when I try to test on other parts of the forehead, I get different readings, so I thought okay, this thermometer is working, it's just my baby whose always at 98.0. Until I read a Facebook post online, the poster said that she always get the same readings as well, but when her little got a fever, she felt her baby being hot and it still reads 98.0.

The Thermoscan wasn't broken, just that it feels outdated.  This No-Touch thermometer is really well-designed.  Simplistic, and intuitive to use.<br /><br />Daughter just came down with a mild cold, and we have been using both the old Thermoscan and this No-Touch thermometer to see if there is any difference in the reading.  While this is not a affirmative test for accuracy, both thermometers' readout are within 0.3 F of each other, so we are fairly confident that both of these are good for their function.<br /><br />Using the No-Touch thermometer:<br /><br />While holding the No-Touch thermometer close to forehead (without touching), press the button once to activate.  Once the No-Touch thermometer vibrates, the scan is complete.<br /><br />There are similar No-Touch thermometers out there for a bit cheaper, but I enjoy the design of this particular model.",B075QQ8VZW,True

Otherwise, the accuracy can be way off. They know that's an issue, that's why in the original instructions it won't be accurate right out of the shipping box. However it is good for taking relative temperatures. The most common example I've used is to check my son's temperature, and then mine. If he doesn't have a fever, we'll be similarly inaccurate. For instance 96.5 and 96.6. If he has a fever, I might register as 96.5, but he'll be 98.7. In this case, the 98.7 is a fairly accurate measure of a real 2 degree in increased temperature (100.6 F).<br /><br />So take it for what it is - super fast, and easy for little kids as they don't have to hold still for very long or be touched, but not the best for the actual temperature unless you have time to spare.",B075QQ8VZW,True

5109121,2020-09-29 19:21:15,5.0,"This device is extremely consistent, reliable and easy to use","All thermometers are a little subjective... meaning, there are a few different ways to actually measure your body temperature, and this devices uses only one of those methods - it’s measuring the IR temp of the temporal artery in your forehead.  But the most important and WONDERFUL thing about this thermometer is that it is extremely consistent!! (When isolating, due to Covid-19 symptoms, I used 2 different thermometers and always got erratic and Highly questionable measurements.  It made me a little crazy for a while.  Until I got this device I couldn’t be sure what my temp was.  Using this device my measurements were consistent from one measurement to another... maybe +/- 0.5 degrees - which is pretty darn good. When it indicated a decreasing temp, and I measured 2 or 3 more times just to be sure, it always measured the same temp, validating that my temp was indeed going down... likewise when it increased).  Apparently some thermometers (the more sophisticated ones) attempt to make corrections to forehead measurements to estimate, or simulate, core temperature - this one does not.  Generally speaking, so I’ve read, forehead measurements with devices like this one are about 1 degree lower than core temp; but that’s OK if you know that’s what you are seeing. In our household, when everyone is well, this device measures between 97.1 and 97.3 degrees F (a little more than 1 degree below average body temp of 98.6F). That body temp can vary between age groups, activity, time of day, metabolism, environment, etc - it’s important to know what normal is for your family ahead of time. I recommend that you measure known healthy people in your household BEFORE judging weather someone has a fever or not. In other words, find out what normal temp is in your household, before you put your faith in (any) device.  For our household I add about 1 degree (1.3 degrees to be more precise) get a more realistic estimate of (core) body temp. So when I get a measurement of 97.3, I know that’s “normal” around here.  But, if I get a measurement of 98.6 with this device, I have reason to believe That it’s really 99.9 degrees F... possible cause for concern.  Of course I would monitor it closely to see if it goes up another 0.5 degree, which would be 99.1 as measured on this device, and , hence (99.1 + 1.3), closer to 100.4 actual core body temp; which would officially be a fever. Note... This is the same device they use at Kaiser Permanente when you walk through the door to go to the pharmacy, or whatever (along with a very sophisticated and much more powerful device that measures everyone from a distance); Kaiser got EXACTLY the same measurement (97.3 F) of my temperature, with the same device, that I got with ours at home. That’s a powerful endorsement!",B075QQ8VZW,True

5117166,2020-06-24 13:05:40,5.0,Simple and does the job,"Though it's just one button and seemingly simple enough to operate. Most people become frustrated with getting this to work. No one should need to read instructions for something so simple unless for changing settings like celcius or fahrenheit.<br /><br />I purchased several of these for the company I work for and use it to test employee temperatures.  I still haven't read how to operate it but I got it right away.  I had to explain this (without reading instructions) to 80% of the users - 1) push button to turn it on 2) get it really close to your forehead (like an inch), 3) push and hold button until it vibrates...done!<br /><br />I believe you have to get so close is because it seems to be very directional. If it's flat purple cap isn't parallel to the forehead, it won't read. I think the angle of the handpiece in relation to the scanner head causes some people to hold the handle parallel to the face, therefore causing the scanner to be slightly pointed to the sky.<br /><br />Once I get people to see how simple it is to use and keep them from throwing it on the floor, it's all good times.<br /><br />Good thing it's not a heart rate or blood pressure monitor because everyone would fail.<br /><br />One reason I was hesitant about purchasing this was because of the apparent lack of contrast on the display. White character read-out on a white body and a white screen seems counter intuitive but there is NO problem with this display. It reads loud and clear.",B075QQ8VZW,True

5147804,2018-05-12 18:36:23,5.0,This is the easiest and quickest thermometer I've ever used!,"I've only had this thermometer for a week and no one has been sick in our household but here is my experience with this device. This is the easiest thermometer that gives the quickest reading hands down of any thermometer I've ever used. I've tested it on 4 different people (different age groups) in my household including myself. I've taken my temperature about 8 times this week just to practice and test the device out. The temperature readings have always been between 97.9 and 99.2 which seems normal - I don't have another thermometer to compare these numbers against, but the range is close enough for my family. The manual came in several languages but English was the primary language. The device is very easy to use - just aim it at the bridge of your nose between your eyebrows, press and hold the button, wait for the device to vibrate, and then look at the reading. My only complaint would be that I wish it came with a small pouch to put the thermometer in. It's not really a big deal - we keep ours in the medicine cabinet but since it's not a device that's not used very often (only when someone's sick or not feeling well), it would be nice to have a small pouch to keep it stored in. Overall, this is an amazing thermometer that works as advertised. I would highly recommend this device if you are in the market for a no touch thermometer.",B075QQ8VZW,True

I like that you don't touch the skin; that it measures temperature from a distance of less than 1.2&#34;, and that it vibrates when it is in proper range. The only thing that is a bit problematic at first is finding the correct range without putting the thermometer on set up mode. Choosing which temperature (F or C) only requires holding the only button down for 8 seconds. The problem is, that it may take a user longer than 8 seconds to find the sweet spot at which the thermometer can measure, inadvertently putting in int set up mode.  This is especially; true for folks with vision limitations, trying to take ones own temperature, or those of us who are distanced-challenged and have a hard time discerning distancing between objects.

I would highly recommend to friends and family with children because you can check temp while the kids are asleep.

It's easy to use -- one-touch in a second or two.  It's forehead only, without a code for in-ear readings, but that's fine for our purposes, and it makes for a sleeker device.  The only negative surprise is that the box indicates a made-on date and an expiration date (about two years from now).  I'm not sure whether that's just for this thermometer or whether it other infrared thermometers have use-by dates; they're all medical devices, and they all have to be calibrated, so perhaps the accuracy of the calibration is time-limited.

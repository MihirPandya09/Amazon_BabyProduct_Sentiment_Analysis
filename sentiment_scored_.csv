10289,1,This thermometer would be great if it was a rechargeable battery. I’m really upset that I have gone through three sets of batteries and only used it a few times when my infant was running a fever. My husband is really ticked off about it. It’s useless. Why do we always have to put new batteries in it just to use it that day and then the batteries be drained completely.

16413,1,I bought this in late July and it quickly started to drain batteries. I thought maybe that's just what happened with these types of thermometers. Went to use it today and it no longer works at all now. Tried replacing the batteries again and nothing. 5 months is all the use we got out of it and it was only used in our home on 2 people and hardly ever! Total waste of money!
